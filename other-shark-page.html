            <h2>Cookie cutter shark</h2>
            <p>
                The cookiecutter shark is one of the most interesting sharks in the ocean, and it never grows bigger
                than 18-20 inches (~50 cm).
                It gets its common name from its feeding strategy of biting off small chunks of much larger animals.

            <h2>Saw shark</h2>

            <p>
                Check this out: sawsharks have a special tool called the "ampullae of Lorenzini" on their saw.
                It's like their electric field detector for spotting hidden prey.

            <p>
                These guys are the ninja hunters of the sea, sneaking around slowly near the bottom, blending in like
                pros to surprise their dinner!

            <h2>Bigeye tresher shark</h2>
            <p>
                Bigeyes are easily recognized by their huge, upward-rotating eyes—10cm long! These eyes give them
                awesome
                vision, even in low light.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plus, they've got grooves on their head that make them look like they're wearing a helmet. Oh, and their
                tail fins can be as long as their bodies! These sharks are both stylish and functional in the ocean.
            </p>
